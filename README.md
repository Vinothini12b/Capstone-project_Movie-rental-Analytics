# Capstone-project_Movie-rental-Analytics
Movie Rental Analytics is a comprehensive data analytics project aimed at analyzing and visualizing movie rental data to derive meaningful insights for business decision-making. The project utilizes a dataset containing information about movie rentals, including customer demographics, rental durations, movie genres, and rental revenue.
The primary objective of this project is to conduct thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the Sakila DVD Rental Store Database. The goal is to derive valuable insights into the rental store's operations, specifically focusing on customer behavior, film rental patterns, store and inventory management, and sales growth.

This analytical initiative aims to lay the groundwork for developing a comprehensive Power BI dashboard. This dashboard will equip stakeholders with data-driven decision-making capabilities for managing the rental store business. The ultimate aim is to improve overall business performance by optimizing film inventory, enhancing customer satisfaction, improving staff performance, and streamlining store operations.
